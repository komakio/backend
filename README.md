# Welcome to Komak‚Äôs open-source repository üôè

## What is Komak?

Komak is an app born out of necessity in the wake of the COVID-19 events. There are people in our community more susceptible or already exposed to the effects of the virus than others. The goal of Komak is to provide a digital platform for healthy volunteers to help out those most in need. 

Komak uses geolocation services to send requests for help with groceries, for example, to nearby volunteers that are willing to help out.

Komak is meant to be open-source, as we need all of the help we can get in this hopefully short-lived endeavor. 

### Safety

Our initiative is born as an attempt to help the current situation, and fight the frustration of not being able to help. We aim to help flatten the curve and protect the ones most at risk of contracting or spreading the virus. 

This a fluid situation, and our hope is that everyone, all over the world, takes the proper precautions that will turn these few months into a distant memory. Our service might change as the situation unfolds, but we hope it can provide some support in the fight against this virus.

In the meantime, however, we have been in contact with medical professionals to give everyone involved the proper advice on staying safe and healthy. We are committed to supporting the use of our service in safe conditions.

You can read our indications for volunteers and at-risk groups [here](https://komak.io/user-instructions/).
